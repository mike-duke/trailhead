# Trailhead

## Project Description

Trailhead is a web application that allows hikers and outdoor enthusiasts to search for trails across multiple National Parks. Hikers can filter their selection by distance, difficulty, and other preferences. Trailhead was built a paired project using ReactJS, the fetch API, and Sass styling at Turing School of Software and Design.
